# **Linear Regression Analysis of Marketing Data**

This analysis examines the relationship between advertising expenditures (YouTube, Facebook, newspaper) and sales using the `marketing` dataset from the `datarium` package.

## **1. Data Preparation & Exploration**

### **Loading & Installing Required Packages**
```r
install.packages("datarium")  # Installs the datarium package if not already present
library(datarium)             # Loads the package containing the marketing dataset
```

### **Viewing & Summarizing the Data**
```r
View(marketing)      # Displays the dataset in a spreadsheet format
summary(marketing)   # Provides descriptive statistics
```

**Dataset Structure:**
- Contains 200 observations of 4 variables:
  - `youtube`: Advertising budget on YouTube (in thousands of dollars)
  - `facebook`: Advertising budget on Facebook (in thousands of dollars)
  - `newspaper`: Advertising budget on newspaper ads (in thousands of dollars)
  - `sales`: Sales figures (in thousands of units)

## **2. Data Splitting (Train & Test Sets)**

```r
set.seed(123)  # Ensures reproducibility
split <- sample(2, nrow(marketing), replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.7, 0.3))
train <- marketing[split == 1, ]  # 70% training data
test <- marketing[split == 2, ]   # 30% test data

dim(marketing)  # Original dataset dimensions
dim(train)      # Training set dimensions
dim(test)       # Test set dimensions
```

**Output Example:**
- Original data: 200 rows Ã— 4 columns
- Training set: ~140 rows
- Test set: ~60 rows

## **3. Linear Regression Modeling**

### **Model Fitting**
```r
model <- lm(sales ~ ., data = train)  # Fits linear model using all predictors
summary(model)                        # Displays model coefficients & statistics
```

**Key Outputs from `summary(model)`:
1. **Coefficients:**
   - Intercept: Baseline sales when all ad budgets are zero
   - `youtube`: Estimated effect of YouTube ads on sales
   - `facebook`: Estimated effect of Facebook ads on sales
   - `newspaper`: Estimated effect of newspaper ads on sales

2. **Model Fit Statistics:**
   - R-squared: Proportion of variance explained by model
   - Adjusted R-squared: R-squared adjusted for number of predictors
   - F-statistic: Overall significance of model
   - p-values: Significance of each predictor

### **Interpreting Coefficients**
Example interpretation:
- If `youtube` coefficient is 0.045, it means:
  "For every $1,000 increase in YouTube ad spending, sales increase by 45 units, holding other variables constant."

## **4. Making Predictions**

```r
# Predicting sales for specific ad budgets:
predictions <- predict(model, data.frame(youtube = 19, facebook = 120, newspaper = 20))
predictions
```

**Output Interpretation:**
- Returns predicted sales (in thousands of units) for:
  - YouTube: $19,000
  - Facebook: $120,000
  - Newspaper: $20,000

## **5. Model Evaluation (Optional Extension)**

To properly evaluate model performance, you could add:

```r
# Predicting on test set
test_predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test)

# Calculating RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
rmse <- sqrt(mean((test$sales - test_predictions)^2))
print(paste("RMSE:", rmse))
```

## **Key Takeaways**

1. **YouTube and Facebook ads** typically show stronger impact on sales than newspaper ads
2. The model can estimate expected sales for given advertising budgets
3. Newspaper advertising often shows weaker or non-significant effects

## **Potential Improvements**

1. Check for multicollinearity between predictors
2. Explore interaction effects (e.g., does social media advertising work better in combination?)
3. Test non-linear relationships
4. Consider regularization (Ridge/Lasso) if overfitting is suspected

This analysis provides a foundation for understanding how different advertising channels contribute to sales performance. The model can be used to optimize marketing budget allocation for maximum sales impact.
