# **Custom Pie Chart Visualization in R**

Here's a detailed explanation of your pie chart code with improvements and best practices:

## **Current Code Analysis**
```r
x <- c(35, 49, 213, 19, 26)
label <- c("money", "food", "ration", "sun", "moon")
colour <- c("red", "blue", "yellow", "green", "pink")
pie_percentage <- round(x*100/sum(x))
pie(x, pie_percentage, main = "life", col = colour)
```

### **What This Code Does:**
1. Creates a numeric vector `x` with 5 values
2. Defines labels for each pie segment
3. Specifies colors for each segment
4. Calculates percentages (rounded to whole numbers)
5. Generates a pie chart titled "life"

## **Improved Version with Enhancements**
```r
# Data preparation
values <- c(35, 49, 213, 19, 26)
categories <- c("money", "food", "ration", "sun", "moon")
colors <- c("red", "blue", "gold", "green", "pink")  # Changed yellow to gold for better visibility

# Calculate percentages
percentages <- round(values * 100 / sum(values), 1)  # 1 decimal place for precision

# Create labels with percentages
labels_with_pct <- paste0(categories, "\n", percentages, "%")

# Generate pie chart with improvements
pie(values, 
    labels = labels_with_pct,  # Shows category and percentage
    col = colors,
    main = "Life Composition Analysis",
    border = "white",  # Clean white borders between segments
    lty = 1,           # Solid line type
    radius = 1,        # Full radius
    clockwise = TRUE,  # Draw clockwise
    init.angle = 90)   # Start at top

# Add legend (alternative to labels inside chart)
legend("topright", 
       legend = categories,
       fill = colors,
       title = "Categories")
```

## **Key Improvements Made:**

1. **Better Variable Names**: More descriptive than `x`, `label`
2. **Enhanced Percentages**: Now shows 1 decimal place for precision
3. **Combined Labels**: Displays both category name and percentage
4. **Chart Customization**:
   - Clean white borders between segments
   - Controlled starting angle (90° = top)
   - Clockwise rendering
5. **Dual Labeling**: Both inside segments and legend
6. **Improved Title**: More descriptive than just "life"

## **Best Practices for Pie Charts**

1. **Limit Categories**: Pie charts work best with ≤6 categories
2. **Order Segments**: Place largest segment at top (12 o'clock position)
3. **Color Selection**:
   - Use distinct, non-clashing colors
   - Consider colorblind-friendly palettes
4. **Label Clearly**:
   - Include absolute values or percentages
   - Ensure text remains readable
5. **Consider Alternatives**:
   - For many categories, use bar charts instead
   - For precise comparisons, consider stacked bars

## **Common Customization Options**

```r
pie(values, 
    labels = NA,  # No labels inside slices
    edges = 200,  # Smoothness of circle
    density = NULL,  # For patterned fills
    angle = 45,   # Shading angle if using patterns
    cex = 1.2)    # Label size multiplier
```

This enhanced version makes your visualization more informative and professional while maintaining the original intent of showing proportional composition.
