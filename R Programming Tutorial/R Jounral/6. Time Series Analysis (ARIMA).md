# **Comprehensive Time Series Analysis of AirPassengers Data**

This analysis explores the famous `AirPassengers` dataset, which contains monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. Below is a structured breakdown of each component:

## **1. Data Overview**
```r
AP <- AirPassengers
start(AP)  # Jan 1949
end(AP)    # Dec 1960
```

## **2. Basic Visualization**
### **Time Series Plot with Trend Line**
```r
plot(AP, type="l", main="Air Passengers (1949-1960)")
abline(lm(AirPassengers~time(AirPassengers)), col="red")
```
- Shows clear **upward trend** and **seasonal patterns**
- The red trend line confirms increasing passenger numbers over time

## **3. Time Series Decomposition**
```r
plot(decompose(AP))
```
Decomposes into three components:
1. **Trend** - Long-term growth pattern
2. **Seasonal** - Repeating annual pattern
3. **Random** - Irregular fluctuations

## **4. Seasonal Analysis**
### **Monthly Distribution (Boxplot)**
```r
boxplot(AirPassengers~cycle(AirPassengers), 
        main="Monthly Distribution",
        xlab="Month", ylab="Passengers")
```
- Reveals **summer peaks** (June-August)
- Shows **winter troughs** (November-February)

### **Seasonal Plot**
```r
library(fpp)
seasonplot(AirPassengers, year.labels=TRUE, 
           col=rainbow(15), pch=19, lwd=2)
```
- Compares yearly patterns
- Confirms **consistent seasonal behavior** year after year

## **5. Data Transformation**
### **Log Transformation**
```r
plot(log(AirPassengers), main="Log-Transformed Data")
```
- Stabilizes **variance** (reduces increasing spread)
- Makes multiplicative patterns additive

### **Differencing**
```r
plot(diff(AirPassengers), main="Differenced Series")
```
- Removes **trend** to make series stationary
- Helps identify underlying patterns

## **6. Correlation Analysis**
### **Autocorrelation (ACF)**
```r
acf(AirPassengers)               # Original series
acf(diff(log(AirPassengers)))    # Transformed series
```
- Shows **strong seasonal correlation** at lag 12
- After transformation, correlations become more meaningful

### **Partial Autocorrelation (PACF)**
```r
pacf(AirPassengers)
pacf(diff(log(AirPassengers)))
```
- Helps identify **AR terms** for modeling
- Shows direct relationship between observations

## **7. ARIMA Modeling**
### **Model Specification**
```r
model <- arima(log(AirPassengers),
              order=c(0,1,1),          # Non-seasonal: I(1) with MA(1)
              seasonal=list(order=c(0,1,0), period=12))
```
- Uses **log transformation** and **differencing**
- Simple seasonal structure (just differencing)

### **Forecasting**
```r
prediction <- predict(model, n.ahead=48)  # 4-year forecast
air_predict <- exp(prediction$pred)       # Convert back from log

ts.plot(AirPassengers, air_predict,
        log="y",          # Log-scale y-axis
        lty=c(1,3),       # Line types
        col=c("black","red"),
        main="12-Year Data vs 4-Year Forecast")
```
- Forecast continues the **trend and seasonal patterns**
- Confidence intervals show **prediction uncertainty**

## **Key Insights**
1. **Strong Growth Trend**: Passenger numbers increased steadily
2. **Consistent Seasonality**: Predictable summer-winter patterns
3. **Multiplicative Patterns**: Variance grows with mean (fixed by log transform)
4. **Good Forecastability**: Regular patterns enable reliable predictions

## **Recommendations**
1. **Capacity Planning**: Prepare for summer peaks
2. **Marketing Timing**: Target promotions before seasonal highs
3. **Model Refinement**: Consider adding:
   - External regressors (economic indicators)
   - More complex seasonal terms
   - Intervention analysis for special events

This analysis provides a complete workflow from exploration to forecasting, demonstrating fundamental time series techniques applicable to many business contexts.
