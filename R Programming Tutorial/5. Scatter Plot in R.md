# **Scatter Plot Analysis: MPG vs. Weight in mtcars Dataset**

Here's a detailed explanation and enhanced version of scatter plot visualizing the relationship between fuel efficiency (MPG) and vehicle weight (WT) in the classic `mtcars` dataset.

## **Basic Plot (Your Original Code)**
```r
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt,
     xlim = c(1,50), ylim = c(1,7),
     ylab = "WT", xlab = "MPG")
```

### **What This Shows:**
- X-axis: Miles per gallon (MPG) from 1 to 50
- Y-axis: Weight in tons (WT) from 1 to 7
- Each point represents one of the 32 car models in the dataset

## **Enhanced Visualization**
```r
# Set up the plot with improved formatting
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt,
     xlim = c(10,35), ylim = c(1.5,5.5),  # More focused axis ranges
     xlab = "Miles Per Gallon (MPG)", 
     ylab = "Weight (tons)",
     main = "Fuel Efficiency vs. Vehicle Weight",
     pch = 19,            # Solid circle points
     col = "royalblue",    # More professional color
     cex = 1.3,           # Slightly larger points
     las = 1,             # Horizontal axis labels
     bty = "n")           # Clean, no box around plot

# Add grid lines for better readability
grid(col = "gray80", lty = "dotted")

# Add regression line to show trend
abline(lm(wt ~ mpg, data = mtcars), 
       col = "firebrick", lwd = 2)

# Label some notable outliers
text(mtcars$mpg[c(15,16,20)], mtcars$wt[c(15,16,20)]+0.2,
     labels = rownames(mtcars)[c(15,16,20)],
     cex = 0.8, col = "darkgreen")

# Add correlation coefficient
correlation <- round(cor(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt), 2)
legend("topright", 
       legend = paste("r =", correlation),
       bty = "n")
```

## **Key Improvements:**

1. **Better Axis Ranges**:
   - Adjusted to `xlim = c(10,35)` and `ylim = c(1.5,5.5)` to eliminate empty space
   - Matches actual data range more closely (MPG: 10.4-33.9, WT: 1.5-5.4)

2. **Enhanced Labels**:
   - More descriptive axis labels including units
   - Added a clear title

3. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Professional color scheme
   - Grid lines for easier value estimation
   - Larger, solid points

4. **Analytical Elements**:
   - Regression line showing the negative relationship
   - Correlation coefficient displayed
   - Selected car models labeled for context

## **Interpretation of Results**

The plot reveals:
- A clear **negative correlation** (r â‰ˆ -0.87) between weight and fuel efficiency
- Heavier vehicles generally get worse gas mileage
- Notable exceptions (like the Chrysler Imperial) are automatically labeled
- The regression line shows the average rate at which MPG decreases as weight increases

## **Alternative Visualization (ggplot2 version)**
```r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=wt)) +
  geom_point(color="royalblue", size=3) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="firebrick", se=FALSE) +
  labs(title="Fuel Efficiency vs. Vehicle Weight",
       x="Miles Per Gallon (MPG)", 
       y="Weight (tons)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_line(color="gray90"))
```

This provides similar insights with a more modern aesthetic.
